# tlm-sterodynamics

Application producing thermal expansion and dynamic sea level projections. Thermal expansion is derived from inputted surface air temperature and ocean heat content projections provided from a climate model emulator. Dynamic sea level is estimated based on the correlation between thermal expansion and local dynamic sea level in the CMIP6 multimodel ensemble. See IPCC AR6 WG1 9.SM.4.2 and 9.SM.4.3.

## Example

This application can run on data projected climate data. For example, you can use the output `climate.nc` file from the [the fair model container](https://github.com/stcaf-org/fair-temperature). Additional input data is also needed.

First, create a new directory and download required input data and prepare for the run, like

```shell
# Input data we will pass to the container
mkdir -p ./data/input
curl -sL https://zenodo.org/record/7478192/files/tlm_sterodynamics_preprocess_data.tgz | tar -zx -C ./data/input
curl -sL https://zenodo.org/record/7478192/files/tlm_sterodynamics_cmip6_data.tgz | tar -zx -C ./data/input

echo "New_York	12	40.70	-74.01" > ./data/input/location.lst

# Output projections will appear here
mkdir -p ./data/output
```

With fair output as an example, drop the `climate.nc` file into `./data/input`.

Now run the container, for example with Docker, like

```shell
docker run --rm \
  -v ./data/input:/input/:ro \
  -v ./data/output:/output \
  ghcr.io/stcaf-org/tlm-sterodynamics:0.2.0 \
  --pipeline-id=1234 \
  --scenario="ssp585" \
  --nsamps=10 \
  --output-gslr-file="/output/gslr.nc" \
  --output-lslr-file="/output/lslr.nc" \
  --climate-data-file="/input/climate.nc" \
  --location-file="/input/location.lst" \
  --model-dir="/input/cmip6/" \
  --expansion-coefficients-file="/input/scmpy2LM_RCMIP_CMIP6calpm_n18_expcoefs.nc" \
  --gsat-rmses-file="/input/scmpy2LM_RCMIP_CMIP6calpm_n17_gsat_rmse.nc"
```

If the run is successful, the output projection will appear in `./data/output`.

## Features

Several options and configurations are available when running the container.

```
Usage: tlm-sterodynamics [OPTIONS]

  Application producing thermal expansion and dynamic sea level projections.
  Thermal expansion is derived from inputted surface air temperature and ocean
  heat content projections provided from a climate model emulator. Dynamic sea
  level is estimated based on the correlation between thermal expansion and
  local dynamic sea level in the CMIP6 multimodel ensemble. See IPCC AR6 WG1
  9.SM.4.2 and 9.SM.4.3.

See this help documentation by running:

```shell
docker run --rm ghcr.io/stcaf-org/tlm-sterodynamics:0.2.0 --help
```

These options and configurations can also be set with environment variables prefixed by TLM_STERODYNAMICS_*. For example, set --gsat-rmses-file as an environment variable with TLM_STERODYNAMICS_GSAT_RMSES_FILE.

The program will take advantage of all available CPU cores to run faster, project local ocean dynamics in parallel across batches of locations. You can control the size of these baches with `--chunksize`. Using larger batches will generally speed up calculation but also increase memory use. The default setting is sensible if you are projecting samples on the magnitude of 10,000s samples or less. When run as a container, you can throttle the program's access to CPU cores. With `docker run` this done with the `--cpus` flag.

## Building the container locally

You can build the container with Docker by cloning the repository locally and then running

```shell
docker build -t tlm-sterodynamics:dev .
```

from the repository root.
